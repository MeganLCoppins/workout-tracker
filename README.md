# workout-tracker

## Description

I created a workout tracker application allowing users to view, create, and track their daily workouts. The user is able to add multiple exercises to a workout on a given day. With each resistance exercise the user is able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps and duration of the exercise. If the user is adding a cardio exercise they are able to track the name, type, duration, and distance traveled. 

## Demonstration
